# rovi_blog

`rovi_blog` (or just Rovi's blog) is my blog. At the time of writing, this is a work in progress, so what you're seeing here isn't complete.

Technically, this is the second version of my blog, so "internally" it's `rovi_blog_v2`, but I'm trying to avoid having version numbers for repo names.
