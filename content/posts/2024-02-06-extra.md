In the posts page, I have all the posts in this website listed in chronological order. Above the list, there's a sentence that displays the amount of posts I've written. It should look something like this:

> There are 20 posts in total.

However, at the time I added it in (three minutes ago for me), there was only one post.

> There are 1 posts in total.

Not ideal, as you can imagine.

I can't be bothered to properly fix this by checking if `site.posts.size == 1` and doing all the code that comes with handling plurals -- plus, I think it would make the code look wonky -- so I just created this post to increase the post count.

> There are 2 posts in total.

It works.

EDIT: I wrote this for the first version of my blog. For the second one (the current one at the time of writing), I already built in code to handle this without needing to have two posts.
