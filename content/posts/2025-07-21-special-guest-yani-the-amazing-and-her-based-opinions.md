hey guys welcome back to the first blog psot by the most amazing special guest, i am better in every way compared to the orginal writer. anyways i just wanmt to share some #BASED opinion on coding since i have been stuidying computer sceine for more than 15 years at harvard and MIT and the university of michigan. mhm THATS how experienced i am. i am way better than my little computer NERD of a brother ess ehm eich.

first of all uhm CentOS is SOOOO bad like its gotta be the worst operating system like bro its so bad i cant even do anything is in it, compared to my goat git which is so good and easy and has so many features implemetned in it mhm git is literally peak. you know whats not peak??? jade. both my bum ass enemy and the coding language. BOTH piss me off like why does it only have 1.5 data tables?

second, id really just like to say how much i reccomend GRUNT to everyone. its great for the beginners (like my brother) and the advanced cool children (like ME.) its pretty much good at everything, and can help with everything similar to

which i used before i started using grunt for my microwave coding but it hard to implement weight defrosting with

third, i just really what to express my HATE my HATRED my PURE RELENTLESS HATRED for yellow binder:

. like bro you cant even do anything in it like scratch has more things it can do compared to this STUPID coding language

fourth, id like to say that this might be controversial but i think that the dolphin yin and yang language is sooo hard to read, i can code in it, but its hard to go back and be like "huh. so THATS where the issue is." compared to blue elephant, which i cant always read through easily like a childrens first novel. mhm yup thats a variable you gotta uh count for when picking a coding language you wanna code something in mhm yup thats rsights.

also C+ is so buns hðŸ«²ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£
