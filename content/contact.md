If something's missing or is incorrect, there's a chance that it'll be there on my [LinkTree](https://linktr.ee/johnrcd), as I try and update that first when I can.

If something's wrong on my LinkTree... I should probably fix that.

## bonus

[I have a Guestbook](https://rovi.atabook.org/), if you both know what that is and you want to check it out.

### i don't know what a Guestbook is

It's a page on a website where you (a visitor) can leave a message. I assume they were a big deal on the old internet, because I learned about them through Neocities.

They're pretty cool, I think.

### i don't want to check it out

Awh.
