Apparently guestbooks are thing that you can see on a few websites, typically on the personalized ones you'd fine in Neocities and what not. I think they're cool so I [made one myself](https://rovi.atabook.org/).

(Alternatively, if you prefer to see the link: [https://rovi.atabook.org/](https://rovi.atabook.org/)).

I was hoping for something where you could paste a form on to your website and you could use an API to send/return the messages on your guest book, but you have to go to the website directly, so I'm unable to use the custom styles I have for the blog. If you're using light mode, you'll have to suffer with dark mode while you're on it.

Also, there was the option to create a logo, so I just made a funny one:
